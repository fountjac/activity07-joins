Activity 7
================
Jackie Fountain

## Data and packages

Load the entirety of the `{tidyverse}`. Be sure to avoid printing out
any unnecessary information and give the code chunk a meaningful name
(hint: we explored R chunk options in a past activity).

``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

In this activity we will explore joining information that is contained
in multiple data files. We will also explore ways of visualizing spatial
data.

The late comedian [Mitch
Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg) believed that La
Quinta (pronounced la KEEN-ta) was Spanish for “next to Denny’s”.

![Mitch
Hedberg](https://duckduckgrayduck.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/mitch-hedberg.jpg)

In the `data` folder, you have been provided with three `.csv` files.
The `dennys.csv` and `laquinta.csv` files contains addresses for the
locations of each respective company. The `states.csv` file contains the
area (thousand square miles) for each US state and the District of
Columbia. These data were scrapped from
[Denny’s](https://locations.dennys.com/) and [La
Quinta’s](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/laquinta/locations) location web
pages by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel.

Read each of the three files using `here::here` in combination with the
appropriate `{readr}` function. Assign each file to a meaningful object
name (e.g., `dennys`,`laquinta`, and `states`), be sure to avoid
printing any unnecessary information. Give your code chunk a meaningful
name.

``` r
dennys <- read_csv(here::here("data","dennys.csv"))
laquinta<- read_csv(here::here("data","laquinta.csv"))
states <- read_csv(here::here("data","states.csv"))
```

### Provide more information

`class`, `str`, `nrow`, `ncol`, and `names` are extremely helpful
functions for quickly getting information about a dataset. Below is a
brief summary of the information that each function provides.

-   `class`: Returns the attribute of the R object
-   `str`: A compact display of the internal structure of an R object.
    This can also be viewed by clicking on the blue circle icon next to
    the R object in the **Environment** pane (upper-right pane).
-   `nrow`: Returns the number of rows in an R object
-   `ncol`: Returns the number of columns in an R object
-   `names`: Get or set the names of an R object (e.g., the column names
    for a dataset)

Use the output from `str` of these datasets to complete the `Type`
column in the partially started data dictionary tables below.

``` r
str(dennys)
```

## Analysis

### Locations in the US

We will limit our analysis to Denny’s and La Quinta’s locations within
the United States Look at the websites that the data come from (linked
above). Are there any La Quinta’s locations outside of the US? What
about Denny’s?

**Response**: Yes, there are La Quinta’s in Mexico No, Denny’s is only
in USA

If we wanted to do this using the datasets, would we need to ? Don’t
worry about implementing this yet, you only need to brainstorm some
ideas. Include at least one idea as your answer, but you are welcome to
write down a few options too.

**Response**: If we are matching the two places together we can join
just on matches

### Preparing to Join

#### Denny’s

Now we will find the Denny’s locations that are outside the US using
code. To do so, *filter* the Denny’s locations for observations where
state is *not in* `states$abbreviation`. Do not assign this to anything;
we only want to see if we need to be aware of non-US cases. If there are
any non-US locations, specify where these are.

``` r
  filter(dennys, !state %in% c(states$abbreviation))
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 x 6
    ## # … with 6 variables: address <chr>, city <chr>, state <chr>, zip <chr>,
    ## #   longitude <dbl>, latitude <dbl>

**Response**: There are no dennys outside of USA

Now do this again, but using `anti_join`. To do so, take the Denny’s
locations and anti-join this with the states dataset. Remember to
specify your `by` columns.

``` r
dennys %>% anti_join(states, by = c("state" = "abbreviation"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 x 6
    ## # … with 6 variables: address <chr>, city <chr>, state <chr>, zip <chr>,
    ## #   longitude <dbl>, latitude <dbl>

#### A Brief Aside

Nothing for you to do here, but I wanted to show you some alternative
approaches. Another way to do what you previously did would be to create
a new variable, then filter on this new variable. Remember that `mutate`
creates new variables. So the `dplyr::case_when` function is a nice way
to do multiple if-else statements.

Using a different example, suppose that Bradford wanted to see if there
are any Denny’s in any the states that they have lived in. We can then
use this `mutate` and `case_when` process as follows.

``` r
dennys %>%
  mutate(bradford_lived = case_when(state %in% c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME") ~ "Yes",
                                    TRUE ~ "No"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,643 x 7
    ##    address             city        state zip   longitude latitude bradford_lived
    ##    <chr>               <chr>       <chr> <chr>     <dbl>    <dbl> <chr>         
    ##  1 2900 Denali         Anchorage   AK    99503    -150.      61.2 No            
    ##  2 3850 Debarr Road    Anchorage   AK    99508    -150.      61.2 No            
    ##  3 1929 Airport Way    Fairbanks   AK    99701    -148.      64.8 No            
    ##  4 230 Connector Dr    Auburn      AL    36849     -85.5     32.6 No

`case_when` looks to see if any of the `dennys$state`s are in the vector
of state abbreviations provided (i.e., `c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME")`). If
this is a `TRUE` statement, then `bradford_lived` will be set to
`"Yes"`. Otherwise, if the values is not a missing value (i.e., `NA`),
the `TRUE ~ "NO"` line sets `bradford_lived` to `"No`. If the values are
missing, they remain missing in `bradford_lived`. Without the
`TRUE ~ "No"` line, all values except for “MI”, “NC”, “IL”, and “ME”
would be set to missing values.

Talk with your team members on why we would want to differentiate
between labeling states as `"No"` and as missing values.

Note that we could have also used
`!(state %in% c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME")) ~ "No"` (i.e., state not in
those listed). However, this would be slightly inefficient to type as
`TRUE ~ "No"` captures this.

Back to our current activity, to create a new variable called `country`
where if the state is in the US, `country` is set to `"United States"`
we would then do:

``` r
dennys %>% 
  mutate(country = case_when(
    state %in% states$abbreviation ~ "United States",
    TRUE ~ "Other")) %>% 
  filter(country != "Other")
```

#### La Quinta

Determine if La Quinta has any locations that are outside of the US.

#### Isolating US locations

For the rest of this activity, we will work with the data from the
United States *only*. All Denny’s locations in our file are in the US so
we do not need to worry about updating this object, but you do need to
do some work on the `laquinta` data. Create a new object called
`laquinta_us` that only contains the locations inside the US.

``` r
laquinta_us <-filter(laquinta, state %in% c(states$abbreviation))
```

### Fewest locations

Let’s test some of our data summary skills.

Which US state(s) has/ve the fewest Denny’s location?

``` r
dennys %>% count(state)%>% arrange(n)
```

    ## # A tibble: 51 x 2
    ##    state     n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 DE        1
    ##  2 DC        2
    ##  3 VT        2
    ##  4 AK        3
    ##  5 IA        3
    ##  6 NH        3
    ##  7 SD        3
    ##  8 WV        3
    ##  9 LA        4
    ## 10 MT        4
    ## # … with 41 more rows

**Response**:Deleware

Which US state(s) has/ve the fewest La Quinta locations?

``` r
laquinta_us %>% count(state)%>% arrange(n)
```

    ## # A tibble: 48 x 2
    ##    state     n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 ME        1
    ##  2 AK        2

    ##  5 SD        2
    ##  6 VT        2
    ##  7 WV        3
    ##  8 WY        3
    ##  9 IA        4
    ## 10 MI        4
    ## # … with 38 more rows

**Response**:Maine

Is this surprising to you? Why or why not?

**Response**: Not surprising they are both small states

### Locations per thousand square miles

Next we will calculate which states have the most Denny’s and La Quinta
locations per thousand square miles. To do this, we will need to join
each company’s tibble with the information in the `states` tibble.

#### Denny’s

1.  Take the `dennys` tibble and determine how many observations are in
    each state. This should have two columns: `state` and `n`.
2.  *Then*, use `inner_join` to join the previous information to the
    `states` tibble. Note that the variables in the `states` tibble has
    the two letter abbreviations in a column called `abbreviation`.
    Therefore, we will need to specify that the `state` variable from
    the `dennys` tibble should be matched `by` the `abbreviation`
    variable from the `states` tibble.
3.  *Then*, calculate the number of Denny’s locations *per* thousand
    square miles.

Which states have the most Denny’s locations per thousand square miles?

**Response**:

#### La Quinta

Similarly as we previously did for Denny’s, calculate the number of La
Quinta locations *per* thousand square miles.

**Response**:

<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/>
<b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good
understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your
project. The remainder of this activity will deal with creating map data
visualizations.

### Mapping locations

To be able to map all of the `dennys` and `laquinta` locations, we
should combine them into one dataset.

Both of these tibbles have the same columns in the same order (i.e.,
`address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `longitude`, `latitude`, `country`)
so we can simply stack them on top of each other by using `bind_rows`.

Why would it not be wise to use a mutating join (e.g., `inner_join`,
`left/right_join`, `full_join`) for these data? That is, both of the
datasets have the same variable names, would it not make sense to join
them at the same address?

**Response**:

If we were able to use a mutating join, what would this output would
look like? Why would this not be helpful?

**Response**:

You were already shown these top-notch animations from [Garrick
Aden-Blue](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/). Again,
they are a little old as they still use `spread` and `gather`, but the
`*_join` are still accurate.

Prior to combining these datasets, it would be nice to know which
company each location belongs to.

``` r
pre_join_dennys <- dennys %>% 
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")

pre_join_laquinta_us <- laquinta_us %>% 
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta")
```

Now, stack these two `pre_join_*` tibbles on top of each other. After
you have verified the stacking worked, assign the resulting object to
`dennys_laquinta`.

We can plot the locations of the two establishments using a scatter plot
and color the points by the establishment type. Note that longitude
should be plotted on the *x*-axis and latitude on the *y*-axis.

**Response**:

### Challenge: More with visualizing

The following two items ask you to create visualizations. These should
follow best practices such as informative titles, axis labels, etc. See
<http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html> for help with the
syntax.

You can also choose different themes to change the overall look of your
plots. See <http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html> for
help with these.

The general idea here is that create the map using a dataset of shape
files, then overlay a layer of points using a different dataset.

Note that [choropleth
maps](https://r-charts.com/spatial/choropleth-map-ggplot2/) are slightly
different in that you would need to joining the shape file and the data
containing ammounts to shade each shape.

#### Michigan locations

Filter the data for observations in Michigan only, and create a plot.
Try adjusting the transparency of the points by setting the `alpha`
level (so that it is easier to see the over-plotted ones). Visually,
does Mitch Hedberg’s joke appear to hold in Michigan?

**Response**:

#### Texas locations

Now filter the data for observations in Texas only. Create the plot,
with an appropriate `alpha` level. Visually, does Mitch Hedberg’s joke
appear to hold here?

**Response**:

### Challenge: Dress up your maps

Hadley’s [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html) text shows how to
use the `geom_polygon` and `coord_quickmap` layers to create state
outlines when plotting spatial data.

This blog post series on **r-spatial** goes into a lot more detail for
dressing up maps:

-   [Basics](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html)
-   [Layers](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-2.html)
-   [Layout](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-3.html)

Add state boundaries to each of your maps. Do this within each of the
previous code chunks.
